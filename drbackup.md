## Disaster Recovery
`Recovery Point Objective (RPO):` How much data can be lost?

`Recovery Time Objective (RTO):` How long can a service be down? The **expected** recovery time.

`Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD):` Total downtime before significant impact to the business. The **required** recovery time.

### [Azure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/)
![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/media/guidance-best-practices/azure-backup-architecture.png)

------------

#### Vaults (2)
- [Recovery Services Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview)
	- Configuration information and backup data
	- [Redundancy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-create-recovery-services-vault#set-storage-redundancy)
		- **LRS** (low cost option recommended when Azure vault is not the primary/only store), **GRS** (6 copies across 2 paired regions), **ZRS** (high data durability along with data residency)
		- Must be configured before protecting any workloads. Once a workload is protected in Recovery Services vault, the setting is locked and can't be changed.
		*Storage replication settings for vaults are not relevant for Azure file share backup, because the current solution is snapshot based and no data is transferred to the vault. Snapshots are stored in the same storage account as the backed-up file share.*
	- [Key features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview#key-features), including:
		- [Cross Region Restore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#cross-region-restore): Restore Azure VMs in a secondary (paired) region. By enabling this feature at the vault level, you can restore the replicated data in the secondary region any time. This enables you to restore the secondary region data for audit-compliance, and during outage scenarios, without waiting for Azure to declare a disaster (unlike the GRS settings of the vault).
			- Must be enabled and incurs charges
			- `RPO: 36 hours`
		- **Cross-region backup** (i.e. back up a resource to a recovery services vault in a different region) is not supported for any Azure workload. 
- [Backup Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-vault-overview)
	- Backup data for certain newer Azure Backup workloads e.g. Azure Disks, Azure Blobs, PostgreSQL
	- Redundancy
		- **LRS**, **ZRS**, **GRS**

------------

#### Security (6)
- [Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview#encryption-settings-in-the-recovery-services-vault) of data in transit and at rest
	- Within Azure, data in transit between Azure storage and the vault is protected by HTTPS. This data remains within the Azure network.
	- Backup data
		- Platform-managed keys (by default)
		- Customer-managed keys (stored in key vault)
	- [Azure VMs OS/data disks encrypted with Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-encryption)
- [Soft delete (enhanced in preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-enhanced-soft-delete-about)

- [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-rbac-rs-vault)
	- **Backup Contributor** - Permissions to create and manage backup except deleting Recovery Services vault and giving access to others. "Admin of backup operations"
	- **Backup Operator** - Contributor permissions except for removing backup and managing backup policies. Can't perform destructive operations such as stop backup with delete data or remove registration of on-premises resources.
	- **Backup Reader** - View all backup management operations. "Monitoring role"
- [Multi-user authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/multi-user-authorization-concept?tabs=backup-vault#how-does-mua-for-backup-work)
	- Additional protection on Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. Azure Backup uses another Azure resource called the Resource Guard to ensure critical operations are performed only with applicable authorization. Resource Guard must be owned by a different user.

- [Immutable vault (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-immutable-vault-concept?tabs=recovery-services-vault)
	- Blocks specific operations on the vault and its protected items.
	- Disable/Enable/Enable and Lock (cannot be disabled)
	- Restricted operations e.g., Stop protection with delete data, Modify backup policy to reduce retention, Change backup policy to reduce retention

	- [V2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-private-endpoints-concept) experience
		- Create private endpoints without managed identities.
		- No private endpoints are created for the blob and queue services.
		- Use of fewer private IPs.
