## Availability
`Service-level agreement:` An availability target representing a commitment around performance and availability of an application.

	- **Zonal services**: A resource can be deployed to a specific, **self-selected availability zone** to achieve more stringent latency or performance requirements. Resiliency is self-architected by replicating applications and data to one or more zones within the region. Resources are aligned to a selected zone. For example, virtual machines, managed disks, or standard IP addresses can be aligned to a same zone, which allows for increased resiliency by having multiple instances of resources deployed to different zones.
	- **Zone-redundant services**: Resources are replicated or distributed across zones **automatically**. For example, zone-redundant services replicate the data across multiple zones so that a failure in one zone does not affect the high availability of the data.â€¯
	- **Always-available services:** Always available across all Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages and region-wide outages. Also known as non-regional services e.g. Azure Active Directory.
